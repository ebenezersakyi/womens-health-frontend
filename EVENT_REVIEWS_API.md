## Integration Examples

### Frontend Integration
```javascript
// Create a review
const createReview = async (eventId, reviewData) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/reviews', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      eventId,
      ...reviewData
    })
  });
  return response.json();
};

// Get event reviews with statistics
const getEventReviews = async (eventId, options = {}) => {
  const params = new URLSearchParams(options);
  const response = await fetch(`/api/reviews/event/${eventId}?${params}`);
  return response.json();
};
```

### Backend Integration
```javascript
// Add review stats to event data
const eventWithReviews = await Event.findById(eventId);
const reviewStats = await eventWithReviews.getReviewStats();
const hasReviewed = await eventWithReviews.hasUserReviewed(userId);

// Get reviews for an event
const reviews = await eventWithReviews.getReviews({
  limit: 5,
  page: 1,
  sortBy: 'rating',
  sortOrder: 'desc'
});
```

## Database Schema

### Review Model
```javascript
{
  eventId: ObjectId (ref: Event),
  userId: ObjectId (ref: User),
  rating: Number (1-5, supports 0.5 increments),
  title: String (2-100 chars),
  comment: String (10-1000 chars),
  isAnonymous: Boolean,
  helpfulVotes: Number,
  totalVotes: Number,
  response: {
    text: String (5-500 chars),
    respondedBy: ObjectId (ref: User),
    respondedAt: Date
  },
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Indexes
- `{ eventId: 1, userId: 1 }` (unique) - Prevent duplicate reviews
- `{ eventId: 1, rating: 1 }` - Rating queries
- `{ userId: 1, createdAt: -1 }` - User's reviews
- `{ createdAt: -1 }` - Recent reviews

This comprehensive review system enhances the event management platform by allowing users to share their experiences and help others make informed decisions about attending events.
